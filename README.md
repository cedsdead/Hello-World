Hello humans.

My full name is Cedric Castillo. I like to play video games, mainly Super Smash Bros.
I also enjoy music. Don't really care what genre, as long as it's good.
At this point in time I've only learned a little bit about this coding gig.
I find it very interesting, would love to get proficient at it and maybe even pursue a career in the field.
